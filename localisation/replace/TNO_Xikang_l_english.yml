 POLITICS_LIU_WENHUI_DESC:0 "§Y西康省政府主席§!\n§W------------§!\n§Y字自乾 一八九五年，生于四川省大邑县§!\n\n虽然刘文辉已经过了风华正茂的年纪，但他仍如年轻人一样神采奕奕，一切源于他打不倒、锤不烂的性格。年轻时，他曾遭遇过诸多挫折，却总是能再次爬起。\n\n刘文辉的敌人如同走马灯般挨个粉墨登场，并迅速融入川康两地各派的合纵连横，无论是谁，都没能打倒这个面相憨厚，像是寻常庄稼汉的军头。他相信自己能成事，他的理想不算很远大，能坐上四川督军之位就算成功。\n\n但在利益面前，没有永恒的对手，也没有永恒的朋友。幺爸与侄子的冲突终于无可遏制，战争一触即发，刘湘讨好彼时已掌控中原的蒋中正，在政治上得到支持。再加上邓锡侯与田颂尧的背后捅刀，原本在战争初期占有优势的刘文辉无奈求和，并转而对付田、邓的势力。在又一次的合纵连横之间，刘文辉被三方孤立，他的敌人们已站在了同一边。最终，在将家底折损殆尽前，刘文辉放弃了他的野心，带着残兵败将回到西康休养生息。\n\n在抗日战场上，他昔日的对手们不是战死就是溃败，而刘文辉也开始壮大力量，试图与染指四川的中央政府角力。也就是在此时，曾经在长征中被刘文辉围追堵截的共产党也联系上了这个屯兵西康的旧式军阀，他们愿意摒弃前嫌支持刘文辉，为了生存，他也只能接受递过来的橄榄枝。最终，在各方的妥协下，四川被鸠占鹊巢，但蒋中正始终没能插手西康事务。\n\n中国战场的局势急转直下，而刘文辉也识时务的缩回西康中，继续养精蓄锐。随着大战的结束，本就没有参与的刘文辉同时获得了喘息之机，西康并未被战争所摧毁，也无需治愈创伤。他只需蹲踞在西康的群山间，冷眼旁观众人的命运。大西北战争爆发后，昔日的盟友——共产党人们再度寻求合作，而自认为已实力强劲的刘文辉欣然接受了这一提议，他想借助他们的力量以满足他的野心，他也相信自己能掌控一切，不会成为那些共产党的傀儡。\n\n这个一生只敢梦想过做四川督军的军阀，今日却有些别的想法。"

 xik.1.t:0 "Ya'an calls for aid!"
 xik.1.d:0 "Shocking news today, as clashes sounded within the central Ya'an police station, resulting in the police within the building being expelled! Fearing a greater uprising the governor immediately called for martial law and urgently called for Wenhui to reinforce the city. These fears however seem to have been overblown, with the only extra disturbances being petty criminals with incredibly bad timing. Nonetheless the police station has now been occupied and barricaded by the group, and wenhui's orders have been requested on how to respond to this siege."
 xik.1.a:0 "Who is it that has done this?"
 xik.5.t:0 "Siege in Ya'an Police Station"
 xik.5.d:0 "Arriving in the city Wenhui has asked for further clarification of the situation, only to find himself more confused than before. The station windows have been covered in Chinese republican flags, images of dragons, lotuses and other nationalist symbols, and even a large hand drawn portrait of Liu Wenhui draped over the front doors. Additionally it has been reported by the recently evicted officers that many of the usurpers were quite young, teenagers and some quite well dressed. Whatever their goals it is assumed by our chief of police that they will soon gain access to the weapons safe if they have not already, and urges us to crush the rebellion before it gains weapons and allies. The police blockade stands ready, whatever we choose."
 xik.5.a:0 "It can't hurt to hear them out, order them to account for themselves."
 xik.5.b:0 "Whatever their goals, they have far overstepped. Crush them."
 xik.6.t:0 "Police Have Been Thrown Back!"
 xik.6.d:0 "In a shocking turn of events the initial police assault upon the occupied station has failed to retake the building! Though the initial barricade has been torn down our police were stopped within the doorway as they were pelted from above and crushed by the surprisingly dedicated student mob. Thankfully no lethal weaponry was used despite fears that they may have gotten hold of the armory, but several men have been wounded regardless. Whatever the reason: unwillingness to harm students, shock at the energetic pushback, or just poor planning on the part of our over eager chief two things are clear: we need to train the men in riot control and the occupation is still not over."
 xik.6.a:0 "If the police were too soft to do the job, the army will have to take a shot!"
 xik.6.b:0 "One more chance for the men to redeem themselves. They were caught off guard is all"
 xik.6.c:0 "This is pointless! Let's hear what they have to say: they have earned as much"
 xik.7.t:0 "Success in full!"
 xik.7.d:0 "Upon seeing the disciplined rows of uniformed soldiers, armed with lethal rifles and grenades, the fight went out of Liao. So, their statement had fell on deaf ears. The gamble had failed: Xikang would continue to be ruled by the shallow, the traitorous and the missguided and China would once more be stabbed in the back. With a heavy heart Liao rose to his feet and with hands above his head walked out of the station: he would not die for a failed cause.\n\nWith his surrender hardliners began to fight with those who attempted to follow Liao crying traitor, coward, and any other insult they could imagine. In this broken unity the troops swept into the station, quickly overwhelming the students with scarcely a shot fired. By the end of the day two students lay dead, one soldier had a nasty black eye and the police station had been freed."
 xik.7.a:0 "Finally"
 xik.8.t:0 "What to do with the prisoners?"
 xik.8.desc:0 "We now have on our hands tens of students of varied well being waiting for their fate to be revealed to them. All that is left is for Wenhui to decide what the price of such insubordination should be."
 xik.8.a:0 "Put them in prison until the war is over"
 xik.8.b:0 "A public beating should suffice to remind these children to behave"
 xik.8.c:0 "Simply expel them from their school, that's where these radicals come from"
 xik.8.d:0 "They have learned their lesson: send them back home and let their parents know what happened"
 xik.9.t:0 "The bonfire"
 xik.9.d:0 "Disaster! The students resolve did not crack upon seeing the arrival of regular troops, and so the business of breaching and retaking the police station began. Room to room Wenhui's army proved more than a match for the amateur students until one made a most ill advised decision. Throwing a Zhdanov cocktail into the mass of soldiers the fire quickly spread out of control engulfing the first floor of the building as the troops quickly retreated from the blaze. The students were not so lucky as their own barricades caught them behind the flames and the police station quickly became a charnel house for the students.\n\nWhile a fire response team was immediately summoned and has ensured the flames will not spread to the city it is yet to be seen how many, if any, will be able to survive the blaze and the building itself has been gutted."
 xik.9.a:0 "Horrible!"
 xik.10.t:0 "Burying the corpses"
 xik.10.d:0 "As the last embers guttered out retrieval work began its grizzly business. Through smoke inhalation, burning and even a suicide not one body has been found alive and most are unrecognizable. It seems that all there remains to do is find a resting place for the bodies."
 xik.10.a:0 "Contact the families, it is only right."
 xik.10.b:0 "Get rid of these bodies quickly and discreetly. This is not something to remember."
 xik.9999.t:0 "Parents Vigil"
 xik.9999.desc:0 "Today the families of the deceased have decided to hold a vigil in remembrance of the dead students. Holding lanterns and candles they have taken to the streets in somber silence bringing with them children, elderly and even a few effigies of their departed sons. No slogans, no chants, simply a deep and heart wrenching sense of loss presented to the darkened city. Gatherings of this size are illegal within Ya'an but it may be best to simply let this one pass. Especially as many members are rather affluent members of our society..."
 xik.9999.a:0 "Politely, but firmly tell them to disperse. Now"
 xik.9999.b:0 "Let them grieve without disturbance. Hopefully that will be the end of this."
 xik.9999.c:0 "These people are important. Wenhui shall join them in their remembrance of this tragedy"
 xik.11.t:0 "They threaten a bomb!"
 xik.11.d:0 "The second attempt at forcing through the student mob has proven far more successful than the first, and after a brief but vicious battle of clubs and teargas most students have either been taken into custody or rendered unfit for continued resistance. Only a handful of students remain in revolt, and in desperation it seems they have turned to desperate measures. Who we can only assume to be the leader has threatened to blow up himself and anyone near him should any attempt be made on the boiler room he is barricaded in, and has put forth his demands for an audience with Wenhui. While it is unknown if the threat is credible most everyone is against Wenhui going any closer to the potential threat fearing an attempt on his life, for whatever reason. However there are a few who say this is the only way to deescalate the situation, and some who still think this was all unnecessary bloodshed in the first place..."
 xik.11.a:0 "They're bluffing: breach the room. This ends now."
 xik.11.b:0 "There are far better ways to kill a general than this. Let us try to talk the boy down."
 xik.12.t:0 "The station retaken"
 xik.12.d:0 ""
 xik.13.t:0 "The students demand to see Wenhui!"
 xik.13.d:0 "The police lieutenant sent to make contact with the besieged has returned somewhat flustered to us. The only message he claims they would give him was \"The students shall only present their case to the general Wenhui, not to any third party.\" At the very least it has become clear that the besieged are students, a fact made all the clearer by the pleas of a bedraggled professor who begged for violence to not be used against his wayward students until being temporarily detained. We still are no closer to understanding the motivations of these students, nor do we know what they will do once Wenhui is in sight..."
 xik.13.a:0 "We gave them a chance. Send in the assault."
 xik.13.b:0 "I asked for their statement, and I mean to get it. I'm going in"
 xik.13.c:0 "Perhaps their teachers can talk some sense into them. The geologist seems honest."
 xik.14.t:0 "Students want to meet elsewhere"
 xik.14.d:0 "For the past few hours various faculty from the local university have pleaded with the student rebellion to stand down, or at least open a dialogue with them. It seems that their pleas, backed up by a show of force from the anxious police chief, have had some effect. When the school faculty returned to Wenhui's location the deal offered by the students had been altered. Though they still refused to speak with anyone but Wenhui himself they have agreed to leave the station unarmed on the condition that the general himself appear and give his word that he will hear their case."
 xik.14.a:0 "They shall state their demands on our terms or not at all!"
 xik.14.b:0 "This will get the students out of their fortifications at least."
 xik.15.t:0 "Students refuse to move"
 xik.15.d:0 "Perhaps expectedly negotiations have ground to a standstill as the students will hear no more reason. The chief of police has in the meantime become ever more shrill as rumours spread like wildfire across Ya'an and the students defensive measures grow ever tighter. There is nothing more to be done, the students must be dragged out by their hair and into the light of the law."
 xik.15.a:0 "So be it: send in the men."
 xik.16.t:0 "The Students Manifesto"
 xik.16.d:0 ""
 xik.16.a:0 "You dragged me all this way, nearly killed my police, and put the whole of Ya'an on lockdown... to lecture me about politics?!"
 xik.16.b:0 "Whatever their ideas, it is clear that they are willing to go to extreme lengths to be heard. And that, I can respect."
 xik.17.t:0 "How, and who, to punish"
 xik.17.d_negatively:0 "This student mob has thrown the city into chaos and beaten our police simply to lecture their leader on politics! An example must be made of them and all eyes look to Wenhui for what the verdict on this insubordination shall be."
 xik.17.d_sympathetically:0 "While their actions are treasonous it would be wrong to punish severely simply for an overabundance of patriotism. Additionally it is true that any other means of reaching Wenhui likely would have failed. But regardless the police are livid at this assault on themselves and their honor, and such violent disturbances cannot go without some response from the state..."
 xik.17.a:0 "Toss them and their teachers in jail for years"
 xik.17.b:0 "Lock up the students for years, punish the teachers"
 xik.17.c:0 "Lock up the students until the war ends"
 xik.17.d:0 "Censure the students but no more"
